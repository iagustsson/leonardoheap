/**
 * This class implements the implicit heap data structure that was
 * invented and published by E. W. Dijkstra in 1981 when implementing
 * smoothsort (Smoothsort, an alternative for sorting in situ [EWD82]).
 * @see <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD07xx/EWD796a.html">Java Spec</a>
 *
 * <p>Smoothsort is an in-place sorting algorithm that is a variant
 * of heapsort. Like heapsort, smoothsort has the general characteristic
 * of O(nâ‹…log(n)) when sorting n elements, but for an input that is
 * initially (nearly) sorted, smoothsort is of order O(n), "with a
 * smooth transition between the two, hence its name" [EWD82].

     * is less or equally extreme as the value of its parent) of all
     * the trees in the heap. Also when encountering trees that will
     * not be merged into a larger one at later iteration, the loop

     * form a monotone sequence where each tree is more or equally extreme
     * to the root of its left neighboring tree) of the trees in the heap.
     * After the loop ends, the last element is inserted and the order-

     * third-to-righmost tree is LP[t+trail], where trail is the position of
     * the least significant non-zero in s, and it is rooted at i3=right-LP[t].

     * order-property are "maintained without further measures", but otherwise
     * their roots need to be switched around and other necessary changes to
     * restore those properties (see EWD82).
