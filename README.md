# leonardoheap
Leonardo heap was introduced by E. W. Dijkstra in 1981, as an implicit data structure for smoothsort, 
an in-place sorting algorithm that is a variant of heapsort. Smoothsort sorts an array of n elements by 
transforming the array into implicit Leonardo heap data using only O(1) auxiliary data structure, 
offering on average O(n⋅log(n)) and best-case performance of O(n). 

Like heapsort, smoothsort has the general characteristic of O(n⋅log(n)) when sorting n elements, but 
for an input that is initially (nearly) sorted, smoothsort is of order O(n), "with a smooth transition 
between the two, hence its name"
